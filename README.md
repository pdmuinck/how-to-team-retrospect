# how-to-team-retrospect
What you can do to get the most out of a team sprint retrospective meeting.

- Each team member gets 5-10 minutes to list feedback on things that went good and matters that can improve.
- Team members write things by using standard formats for feedback.
- Each team member gets the same amount of votes.
- Each team member votes the listed topics.
- Topics that got upvoted most will be discussed.
- Discussions should result in clear action items.
- Action items will result in stories for next sprint.

# Use a standard format to give feedback
Good feedback:
I observed (=could have filmed it), which made me feel/think {impact} and my advice is {follow-up action} 

Reviewable actions:
